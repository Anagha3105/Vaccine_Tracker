# Vaccine_Tracker
Fast tracks vaccine queue process by directly interacting with the user and giving respective, condition specific vaccination dates.
Our team "404 not found" has formulated a vaccine tracker which takes in each user’s bio and formulates an approximate vaccination date based
on their information using an algorithm we created. It is an interactive website which not only streamlines this gargantuan task but is also 
informative and erases all doubts and confusion regarding India’s Vaccination drive.
